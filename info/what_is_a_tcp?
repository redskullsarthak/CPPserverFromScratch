tcp--
1.a protocol of how computers talk to each other 

2.data-- fragmented -- packets. (each packet is numbered 1....n)

3.usually there is a fixed window that determines the number of packets that are 
in flight

4.receiver sends an acknowledgment for a recieved packet , sender is waiting for this 
ack

5.sliding window moves if all the contiguous packet segments have recieved ack

6.this is how tcp is reliable and in order 

udps -- send all packets at once , receiver sends a nack for un-received 
packets , this nack only feedback makes udp very performant but unreliable 
and complex as it involves developing algos that restructure these packets
and identify missing packets
